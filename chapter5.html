  <h1>Chapter 5: Confrontation with Darkness</h1>

<p>As the ritual with the black mirror unfolded in the crypt beneath the Blackwood Manor, the spectral figure of betrayal manifested before Sarah. It was a malevolent presence, its eyes filled with malice, as if the darkness of centuries had consumed it.
  The spirits of the Blackwood family gathered around Sarah, their faces etched with anticipation and hope. The confrontation with the spirit of betrayal had begun.
  The sinister entity, bound to the mirror's power, hissed, "Who dares to challenge me?"
  Sarah, her voice unwavering, responded, "I am Sarah, and I am here to seek justice for the Blackwood family. They suffered at your hand, and it's time for you to answer for your crimes."
  The spirit of betrayal let out a wicked laugh, sending shivers down Sarah's spine. "Justice? You are a mere mortal, and you think you can challenge me?"
  The ghostly figures of the Blackwood family, their anguish and rage evident, rallied behind Sarah. Their combined energy began to weaken the spirit of betrayal, making it falter.
  Sarah, guided by the spirits, continued to press the malevolent entity for answers. "Why did you betray your own family? What drove you to such darkness?"
  The spirit of betrayal, its form quivering and dimming, hesitated before revealing a twisted tale of greed, power, and envy. It spoke of the family's once-prosperous estate and how it had yearned to claim it all for itself. The dark rituals it had performed, leading to the gruesome murder of Eleanor Blackwood and her loved ones, had granted it power but at a terrible cost.
  As the spirit recounted its treacherous deeds, the spirits of the Blackwood family wept, their sorrow palpable. Sarah, her heart heavy with the burden of the family's tragic history, realized the enormity of the task ahead.
  The ritual intensified, with the mirror's power surging, pushing the spirit of betrayal to the brink of dissolution. Sarah, her resolve unyielding, delivered the final blow, condemning the malevolent entity to an eternal existence in the dark abyss.
  The spirit of betrayal let out a blood-curdling scream before fading into nothingness, its sinister presence vanquished at last.
  With the malevolent spirit gone, the spirits of the Blackwood family exhaled sighs of relief, their faces filled with gratitude. They began to dissipate, one by one, their ethereal forms fading into the darkness.
  Sarah, standing in the now-silent crypt, felt a profound sense of closure and accomplishment. The spirits of the Blackwood family had found redemption, and their curse had been broken. The Blackwood Manor, once a place of torment, now radiated a sense of peace.
  As she left the mansion, the morning sun began to rise, its warm rays pushing back the shadows that had cloaked the manor for centuries. Sarah's journey to uncover the family's secrets had come to an end, and the haunting legacy of the Blackwood family had finally been put to rest.
  But as Sarah walked away from the manor, a new sense of foreboding took hold. The spirits were gone, but the memories of their torment still lingered in the walls of the old house. The tale of the Blackwood Manor was far from over, and Sarah couldn't shake the feeling that it would continue to cast its shadow over her life.
  What would the future hold for Sarah, and what other secrets did the manor conceal? The darkness had been banished, but its echoes still haunted her, like a chilling whisper in the night.
