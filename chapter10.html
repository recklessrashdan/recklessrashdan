<h1>Chapter 10: The Unveiling of Secrets</h1>

<p>The hidden chamber within the Blackwood Manor had yielded a treasure trove of ancient tomes, manuscripts, and artifacts. Sarah, Mark, Jake, and Emma painstakingly examined these items, determined to unlock the final mysteries of the Blackwood family.</p>

<p>Among the artifacts, they discovered a series of letters between Eleanor Blackwood and a mysterious figure referred to only as "A.G." These letters hinted at a clandestine romance that had unfolded in the shadows, away from the prying eyes of the family.</p>
